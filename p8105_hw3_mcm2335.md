# Problem 1

## Data Import

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = instacart |>
  as_tibble()
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Each row represents a
product from an individual order. There are variables descriping the
item itself, product name, aisle ID, aisle, department ID, and
department, and variables describing the order, including the day of
order, days since order, and hour of day.

# Problem 2

## Data Import & Tidying

# activity tends to decrease as age increases for both men and women across each education category. Female activity levels are higher than men at all ages in the high school equivalent and more than high school groups, and are higher in the less than high school group until around age 40, at which men's activity levels remain consistently above women. The rate at which activity declines across age varies for each education level, but at age 80, mean activity levels are similar for both sexes across all education levels.

#although it is difficult to parse the trends in this graph, it appears that activity levels across the 24 hour time period are lowest at the beginning of the day and peak towards the middle of the day for both males and females in the less than high school and high school equivalent groups, with similar activity levels across both education groups and genders. The trends are different in the more than high school group, where activity peaks for men closer towards the morning or early afternoon, and peaks for women closer towards the evening.
